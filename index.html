            <h1>The food you love</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Fast food is often the default choice. Not only is it convenient and easy to grab, it's also tasty and
                cheap. And fast food joints also serve as great teenage hangout places. Never order “super size” items
                just because it's a cheaper deal</p>
